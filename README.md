# Execututive Summary

[press this linked to be hacked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUufzpoHDE&t=183s&ab_channel=JalayerAcademy)

I guess i can type `use the tilde symbol ~ , not the half quotation '' ` here, so i would like to > quote that i am amazing

just use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl Alt i** so this is the best ever
and to quickly knit the rmd press **Ctrl Shift K**

i can write things as in subscript in r studio ~SomethingLikeThis~ , to use subscript, don't ~UseSpacesBetweenWords~

> below are the R packages/libraries to be used in the report __*help*__


```{r Packages}

# Introduction
This project is chartered to solve the absenteeism issue at __*Canada Stores ltd*__ using data analytics. The absenteeism issue costs the company enormous expenses, and the use of data analytics can identify the most contributing factors that lead to absenteeism and can tap into recommendations to tackle this HR challenge.

Using the provided data, we'll define the underlying problem using root-cause analysis. Then, investigate the available data elements and features at our disposal to inspire insights. And finally, evaluate and enhance data quality.

## 1-    Problem Definition
We have a set of data features obtained from HR records about employees containing __*8336*__ entries.
